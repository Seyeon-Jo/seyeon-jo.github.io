üìã This is my note-taking from what I learned in the class "Software Requirements Engng"
{: .notice--danger}

<br>

## 1. Primary actors interact to achieve required system function and derive the intended benefit from the system.They work directly and frequently with the software. What are secondary actors?

- Secondary actors are often only found during further investigation and added to the system
- Secondary actors are not considered as important as primary actors.
- `Secondary actors support the system so that primary actors can do their work.`
- Secondary actors represent the customers and end users.

## 2. What is meant by the term ‚Äútrigger‚Äù when referring to software engineering use cases?

- `The trigger identifies the event or condition that starts the use case`
- The trigger is used to show a pathway from the event to a condition to start
- The trigger is a precondition that describes what is known to be true
- The trigger lists the specific actions that are required by the actor and the appropriate system responses

## 3. Which of the following BEST explains the use of the UML activity diagrams?

- `The UML activity diagram supplements the use case by providing a graphical representation of the flow of interaction within a specific scenario.`
- The UML activity diagram uses a computer-based tool to develop activity maps.
- A UML activity diagram only displays top-level flows within a scenario.
- A UML activity diagram is used instead of a typical use case as it shows a graphical representation of the flow with a scenario.
- None of the above.

## 4. Alistair Cockburn characterizes a use case as a ‚Äúcontract for behavior.‚Äù What does contract mean here? Select all that apply.

- `Contract defines the way in which an actor uses a computer-based system to accomplish some goal.`
- Contract defines the way in which an actor uses an aspect-oriented system to accomplish some goal.
- `Contract defines the way in which an actor uses an object-oriented system to accomplish some goal.`
- Contract defines the way in which an actor uses a data-oriented system to accomplish some goal.

## 5. In order to derive a reasonably complete set of exceptions for each use case, what does Cockburn recommend?

- A flowchart
- Thinking
- `Brainstorming`
- A scenario

## 6. In the formal approach for writing a use case, what does a goal in context identify?

- It identifies the event or condition that gets the use case started.
- It identifies the specific actions that are required by the actor and the appropriate system responses.
- It identifies what is known to be true before the use case is initiated.
- `It identifies the overall scope of the use case.`

## 7. In a formal use case, a [_____] describes what is known to be true before the use case is initiated.

- scenario
- `precondition`
- trigger
- goal in context

## 8. Use cases within the software engineering project tells a story about how the end user interacts with the system. What would be the first step in developing a use case?

- The first step would be to develop the story.
- `The first step would be to define the actors.`
- The first step would be to define the roles.
- The first step would be to determine communication.

## 9. Identify the limitations of a use case scenario. Select all that apply.

- A use case can be inappropriate to define functional requirements
- `A use case can be inappropriate for nonfunctional requirements.`
- A use case cannot be used to describe behavioral requirements
- `A use case cannot be used when significant detail precision is required`

## 10. A(n) [________] captures the interactions that occur between producers and consumers of information within the system itself.

- Workflow
- `Use case`
- Swimlane diagram
- State diagram

## Summary

In summary hope we all understand the meaning and importance of requirements engineering process and tasks. The "Requirements model" also called the "Analysis model" is the first technical representation of the system and should reflect what the new system should do. We build the Analysis model using outputs from the requirements engineering tasks. We also explained the "Analysis rules of thumb" which are key to a successful requirements engineering exercise.

The "Requirements model" also called the "Analysis model" is built from a number of different points of view "Scenario based", "Class-oriented scenarios" and "Behavioral scenarios".

"Domain Analysis" is important to look at while building the analysis models to re-use any analysis patterns available from the domain, this will lead to speed up the development of abstract analysis models by providing reusable analysis models.

In this unit we focused on the "Scenario based" models, as they reflect the user point of view, because at the end of the day end user satisfaction is one of the most important factors for a successful software project. In the next few units we will take a look at the other two points of view of the "Analysis model".
