# Developing Textual Descriptions

In developing a textual model, you might wonder about the following:

## 1. What should we write about?

- Inception and elicitation - provide you with the information youâ€™ll need to begin writing use cases.
- Requirements gathering meetings, and other requirements engineering mechanisms are used to:
  : - identify stakeholders
  : - define the scope of the problem
  : - specify overall operational goals
  : - establish priorities
  : - outline all known functional requirements, and
  : - describe the things (objects) that will be manipulated by the system.
- To begin developing a set of use cases, list the functions or activities performed by a specific actor.

## 2. How much should we write about it?

- As further conversations with the stakeholders progress, the requirements gathering team develops use cases for each of the functions noted.
- In general, use cases are written first in an informal narrative fashion.
- If more formality is required, the same use case is rewritten using a structured format similar to the one mentioned in Topic 4.3.

## 3. How detailed should we make our description?

- It really depends on the nature and size of the project.

## 4. How should we organize the description?

- Use the template mentioned in section 4.3.

## Reviewing a Use-Case

- Use-cases are written first in narrative form and mapped to a template if formality is needed
- Each preliminary scenario should be reviewed and refined to see if alternative interactions are possible
  : - Can the actor take some other action at this point?
  : - Is it possible that the actor will encounter an error condition at some point? If so, what?
  : - Is it possible that the actor will encounter some other behavior at some point? If so, what?

## Exceptions

- Describe situations (failures or user choices) that cause the system to exhibit unusual behavior
- Brainstorming should be used to derive a reasonably complete set of exceptions for each use case
- Are there cases where a validation function occurs for the use case?
  : - Are there cases where a supporting function (actor) fails to respond appropriately?
  : - Can poor system performance result in unexpected or improper use actions?
- Handling exceptions may require the creation of additional use cases
