{: .notice--danger}

<br>

# Overview

- Individuals and teams build software, without skilled motivated people success is unlikely
- A software team will only be successful if the team dynamics are right
- Software engineers must work well with each other and the project stakeholders
- It is important to understand the personal characteristics of successful software engineers and the psychology of software engineering work
- It is important to appreciate the impact of social media, the cloud, and other collaborative tools on team software engineering process

<br>

# Traits of Successful Software Engineers

- Sense of individual responsibility
- Acutely aware of the needs of team members and stakeholders
- Brutally honest about design flaws and offers constructive criticism
- Resilient under pressure and does not allow performance to suffer
- Heightened sense of fairness (credits colleagues and avoids conflict of interests)
- Attention to detail (performance, cost, quality)
- Pragmatic (software engineering is not a religion)

<br>

# Boundary Spanning Roles

- Ambassador - represents team to outside constituencies to negotiate time and resources or to obtain feedback
- Scout - crosses team boundaries to collect organizational information
- Guard - protects access to team work products and artifacts
- Sentry - controls information sent to team by stakeholders
- Coordinator - focuses on communicating horizontally across the team and organization

<br>

# Effective Software Team Attribute

- Sense of purpose
- Sense of involvement
- Sense of trust
- Sense of improvement
- Diversity of team member skill sets

<br>

# Toxic Team Environment Characteristic

- Frenzied work atmosphere
- High frustration that causes friction among team members
- Fragmented or poorly coordinated software process
- Unclear definition of roles on the software team
- Continuous and repeated exposure to failure
- Differing and incompatible team member human traits

<br>

# Project Factors to Consider in Determining Team Structure

- Difficulty of problem to be solved
- Size of resultant problem in terms of lines of code or function points
- Time team will stay together (team lifetime)
- Degree to which a problem can be modularized
- Required quality and reliability of the system to be built
- Rigidity of delivery date
- Degree of project communication required

<br>

# Team Structures

- Closed paradigm - uses traditional hierarchy of authority (e.g. chief programmer team), works well when software produced is similar software created previously
- Random paradigm - team loosely structured, depends on initiative of individual team members, works well when innovation or a technical break through is required
- Open paradigm - work is performed collaboratively with heavy communication and consensus-based decision making, well suited to solution of complex problems, but may not perform as efficiently as other teams
- Synchronous paradigm - relies on natural compartmentalization of a problem and organizes team members to work on pieces of the problem with little active communication among themselves

<br>

# Generic Agile Teams

- Stress individual competency coupled with group collaboration as critical success factors
- People trump process and politics can trump people
- Agile teams as self-organizing and have many structures
- Planning is kept to a minimum and constrained only by business requirements and organizational standards

<br>

# XP Team Values

- Communication - close informal verbal communication among team members and stakeholders and establishing meaning for metaphors as part of continuous feedback
- Simplicity - design for immediate needs nor future needs
- Feedback - derives from the implemented software, the customer, and other team members
- Courage - the discipline to resist pressure to design for unspecified future requirements
- Respect - among team members and stakeholders

<br>

# Role of Social Media in Software Engineering

- Blogs - can be used share information with team members and customers
- Micro-blogs (e.g. Twitter) - allow posting of real-time messages to individuals following the poster
- Targeted on-line forums - allow participants to post questions or opinions and collect answers
- Social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) - allows connections among software developers and related technologists for the purpose of sharing information or finding problem expertise
- Social book marking (e.g. Delicious, Stumble, CiteULike) - allow developers to keep track of and share web-based resources of interest to a community of like-minded individuals

<br>

# Cloud Services

- Benefits
  : - Provides access to all software engineering work products and artifacts
  : - Removes device dependencies and is available every where
  : - Provides new avenues for distributing and testing beta software
  : - Allows software engineering information developed by one member to be available to all team members
- Concerns
  : - Dispersing the cloud services over resources outside the control of the software team may present reliability and security risks due
  : - With a large number of services distributed across the cloud the potential for interoperability problems becomes high
  : - Cloud development services need to stress usability and performance which often is on conflict with security, privacy, and reliability

<br>

# Collaboration Tool Services

- Namespace or repository that allows secure, private storage or work products
- Calendar for coordinating meetings and project events
- Templates that allow team members to create artifacts that have common look and feel
- Metrics support to allow quantitative assessment of each team memberâ€™s contributions
- Communication analysis tracks messages and isolates patterns that may imply problems or issues to resolve
- Artifact clustering showing work product dependencies
  <br>

# Team Decision Making Complications

- Problem complexity
- Uncertainty and risk associated with the decision
- Work associated with decision has unintended effect on another project object (law of unintended consequences)
- Different views of the problem lead to different conclusions about the way forward
- Global software teams additional challenges associated with collaboration, coordination, and coordination difficulties
- Distance complicates communication and coordination, cultural differences are a common side effect that can affect global software team collaboration
