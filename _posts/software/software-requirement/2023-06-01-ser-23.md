# Requirements Traceability

`Traceability` is a software engineering term that that refers to documented links between software engineering work products.

A `Traceability matrix` allows a requirements engineer to relate requirements to other software other software engineering products such as test cases, code... etc.

`Rows of the traceability` matrix express requirements.

`Columns of the traceability` matrix describe the working products of the software engineering for example a use case, design element, test case related to the traceability matrix.

Below an example:

Traceability matrices can support a variety of software engineering activities such as:

1. Continuity for developers as a project moves forward from one phase to another
2. Ensure all the Engineering work products have taken all the requirements into account
