# Safe Home Case Study

Throughout this course we will be using a case study example called "Safe Home". The Safe Home company has developed an innovative hardware box that implements wireless Internet (802.11) connectivity in a very small form factor (the size of a matchbook). The idea is to use this technology to develop and market a comprehensive home automation product line. This would ultimately provide not only security functions, but also would enable control over telephone answering machines, lights, heating, air conditioning, and home entertainment devices. The first generation of the system, described here, will only focus on home security since that is a market the public readily understands.
