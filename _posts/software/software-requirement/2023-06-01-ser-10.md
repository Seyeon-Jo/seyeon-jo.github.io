# Understanding Requirements

- Requirements engineering helps software engineers better understand the problems they are trying to solve.
- Building an elegant computer solution that ignores the customerâ€™s needs helps no one.
- It is very important to understand the customerâ€™s wants and needs before you begin designing or building a computer-based solution.
- The requirements engineering process begins with inception, moves on to elicitation, negotiation, problem specification, and ends with review or validation of the specification.
- The intent of requirements engineering is to produce a written understanding of the customerâ€™s problem.
- Several different work products might be used to communicate this understanding (user scenarios, function and feature lists, analysis models, or specifications).

Requirements engineering builds a bridge to design and construction.

Requirements engineering establishes a solid base for design and construction. Without it, the resulting software has a high probability of not meeting customerâ€™s needs.
