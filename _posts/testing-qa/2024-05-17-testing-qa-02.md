# Quality Assurance in Software Development

## Philosophy and History of Quality Assurance

### Origins of Quality Assurance
- **Quality Assurance (QA)** initially focused on the physical inspection of products but evolved to include processes and systems.
- Early influencers like Walter Shewhart and W. Edwards Deming emphasized statistical methods to improve quality, known as Statistical Quality Control (SQC).

### Pioneers of Quality Management
- **Joseph M. Juran** and **Philip B. Crosby** were key figures, advocating for quality as a core business strategy.
- **Deming's 14 Points** and **Juran's Trilogy** were foundational to integrating quality into business management.

## Defining Quality in Software
- Quality in software means that the software meets both specified requirements and user expectations effectively and efficiently.
- Attributes of software quality include:
  - **User Expectations**: How well the software meets user needs.
  - **Measurable Attributes**: Quantifiable factors like response time and error rates.
  - **Fitness for Use**: The software's ability to perform its intended functions.
  - **Value for Money**: The return on investment from the software.

## Challenges in Ensuring Software Quality
- The intangible nature of software makes it challenging to measure and improve quality.
- Software development is often seen as a craft, leading to variability in processes and outcomes.
- Rapid technological changes and tight schedules can divert focus from quality.

## Evolution of Quality Practices
- **Early 20th Century**: Quality focused on individual product inspection.
- **Post WWII**: Emphasis shifted to process improvement to enhance quality, influenced heavily by the needs of military precision and reliability.
- **Total Quality Management (TQM)**: A comprehensive approach adopted in the 1970s, emphasizing organizational process improvements.

## Key Concepts in Quality Assurance
- **Prevention over Inspection**: Modern QA emphasizes preventing defects rather than detecting them post-facto.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Quality is viewed as a continuous process that involves constant adjustments and improvements.
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Quality improvement is seen as a cross-functional effort that involves various stakeholders from developers to end users.

## Modern Quality Initiatives
- **ISO 9000 Series**: Standards for quality management systems that emphasize customer satisfaction.
- **Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award**: Recognizes U.S. organizations for performance excellence and quality achievements.
- **Six Sigma**: A method that focuses on reducing defects and improving quality, initially developed by Motorola.
