# Fundamental Data Structures - Part 1

## Arrays

### Definition
Arrays are collections of items stored at contiguous memory locations and accessible via indices.

### Operations
- **Add**: To add a new element at a specific index, existing elements must be shifted to make space.
- **Remove**: Removing an element requires elements after it to be shifted to fill the gap.

### Examples in Java
```java
int[] array = new int[5];  // Declaring an array of integers with 5 elements
array[0] = 10;             // Assigning a value to the first element
System.out.println(array[0]); // Accessing the first element
```

## Singly Linked Lists

### Definition
A singly linked list consists of nodes that are linked together by a single link or reference.

### Operations
- **Insert at Head**: A new node is added at the beginning, pointing to the previous head.
- **Insert at Tail**: A new node is added at the end and the last node's link is updated to this new node.
- **Remove at Head**: The head is updated to the next node.
- **Remove at Tail**: More complex because it requires traversal from the head to the second-last node.

### Structure
Each node in a singly linked list contains data and a reference to the next node.

#### Code Example for Singly Linked Lists
```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList {
    Node head;
    
    void addAtHead(int data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        newNode.next = head;
        head = newNode;
    }
    
    void removeAtHead() {
        if (head != null) {
            head = head.next;
        }
    }
}
```

## Doubly Linked Lists

### Definition
Doubly linked lists allow traversal in both directions (forward and backward) because each node points to both its predecessor and successor.

### Operations
- **Insertion**: Nodes can be inserted in between two nodes efficiently.
- **Deletion**: Nodes can also be removed efficiently because each node knows its predecessor.

### Structure
Each node contains a reference to the previous node, the data, and the next node.

#### Code Example for Doubly Linked Lists
```java
class DoublyNode {
    int data;
    DoublyNode prev;
    DoublyNode next;
    
    DoublyNode(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList {
    DoublyNode head;
    
    void add(int data) {
        DoublyNode newNode = new DoublyNode(data);
        newNode.next = head;
        if (head != null) {
            head.prev = newNode;
        }
        head = newNode;
    }
    
    void remove(DoublyNode node) {
        if (node.prev != null) {
            node.prev.next = node.next;
        } else {
            head = node.next;
        }
        if (node.next != null) {
            node.next.prev = node.prev;
        }
    }
}
```
