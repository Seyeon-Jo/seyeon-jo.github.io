# Java Compiler

## Definition

Java is a compiled language, meaning programs are first compiled into bytecode and then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

```plaintext
Source Code (.java) â†’ Bytecode (.class) â†’ Executed by JVM
```

<br>

# Components of a Java Program

## Definition

In Java, the basic building block is the class, which contains methods (functions). The `main` method is the entry point for any Java application.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
```

<br>

# Identifiers

## Definition

Identifiers are the names used for classes, methods, and variables in Java. They must start with a letter and can include numbers.

```java
int number;
String name;
```

<br>

# Base Types

## Definition

Java has several primitive data types used for storing simple values directly.

```java
int age = 30;
double price = 19.99;
boolean isActive = true;
```

<br>

# Classes and Objects

## Definition

A class in Java can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects (instances).

```java
public class Bicycle {
    int gear;
    int speed;

    void changeGear(int newGear){
        gear = newGear;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment){
        speed += increment;
    }
}
```

<br>

# Creating and Using Objects

## Definition

Objects are instances of classes created with the `new` keyword.

```java
Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();
myBike.changeGear(3);
myBike.speedUp(10);
```

<br>

# Wrapper Types and Boxing

## Definition

Java uses wrapper classes for all primitive types to facilitate operations in object-based contexts.

```java
Integer myInt = 5; // Auto-boxing
int x = myInt;     // Auto-unboxing
```

<br>

# Method Signatures

## Definition

The signature of a method in Java includes its name and parameter types, which helps in identifying the correct method to execute.

```java
public void greet(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
}
```

<br>

# Operators

## Definition

Java supports various operators for arithmetic, logical operations, and more.

```java
int result = 1 + 2; // Addition
boolean isTrue = (result == 3);
```

<br>

# Control Structures

## Definition

Java provides control structures such as if-else statements, loops, and switch cases for controlling the flow of execution.

```java
if (isTrue) {
    System.out.println("Result is 3");
} else {
    System.out.println("Result is not 3");
}

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

<br>

# Input and Output

## Definition

Java uses `System.out` for output and `System.in` with a `Scanner` for input.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
String name = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```
