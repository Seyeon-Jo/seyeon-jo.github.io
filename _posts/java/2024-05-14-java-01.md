# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of key object-oriented programming concepts in Java as outlined in the textbook *Data Structures and Algorithms in Java* by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser.

## 1. Classes and Objects
- **Classes and Objects**: Classes act as blueprints for creating objects which are instances of classes.
  ```java
  public class Car {
      String color; // Data member
      void drive() { // Method
          System.out.println("This car is driving.");
      }
  }
  ```

## 2. Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data (variables) and methods within classes to prevent direct access and modification of data.
  ```java
  public class Account {
      private double balance; // Private variable
      public void deposit(double amount) { // Public method
          if (amount > 0) {
              balance += amount;
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## 3. Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: Using existing class features to create new classes.
  ```java
  public class Vehicle {
      int speed;
  }
  public class Bike extends Vehicle { // Inherits from Vehicle
      int wheels = 2;
  }
  ```

## 4. Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: Methods performing different functions based on the object operating upon them.
  ```java
  public class Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("This animal makes a sound");
      }
  }
  public class Dog extends Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Bark");
      }
  }
  ```

## 5. Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**:
  - **Abstract Classes**: Can contain both complete and incomplete methods.
    ```java
    public abstract class Shape {
        abstract void draw(); // Abstract method
        void fillColor() { // Non-abstract method
            System.out.println("Filling color...");
        }
    }
    ```
  - **Interfaces**: Must be implemented by classes with all methods defined.
    ```java
    public interface Flyable {
        void fly();
    }
    public class Bird implements Flyable {
        public void fly() {
            System.out.println("Bird is flying");
        }
    }
    ```

## Design Principles and Patterns
- Principles like robustness, adaptability, and reusability guide software development.
- Design patterns such as Iterator, Adapter, and Factory method address common problems in software design.

## Exception Handling
- Java uses exceptions to manage errors and other exceptional events effectively.
  ```java
  try {
      int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(numbers[5]); // Will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
  } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
      System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
  }
  ```
