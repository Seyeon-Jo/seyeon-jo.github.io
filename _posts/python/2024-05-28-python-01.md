## 1. None <a class='anchor' id='none'></a>

Defines a Null value, or no value at all. Similar to the Null value in other programming languages.

It is not the same as 0, False, or an empty collection.

```python
a = None
print(f'{a} -> {type(a)}')
```

```python
# None is a built-in object that is available to the interpreter
'None' in dir(__builtins__)
```

```python
# Create new instance of None object
b = None
print(f'{b} -> {type(b)}')

# None adopts singleton pattern; therefore, all None objects point to the same instance 
print(id(None)) 
print(id(b))
```

Explanation:
- `None` is used to define a variable with no value.
- `None` is a singleton object, meaning there is only one instance of `None` in a Python runtime.

## 2. Numbers <a class='anchor' id='number'></a>

Python has several built-in types for numbers.

### 2.1 Integers
Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.

```python
a = 10
print(f'{a} -> {type(a)}')
```

### 2.2 Floating Point Numbers
Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential (scientific) notation.

```python
b = 3.14
print(f'{b} -> {type(b)}')
```

### 2.3 Complex Numbers
Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.

```python
c = 1 + 2j
print(f'{c} -> {type(c)}')
```

### 2.4 Booleans
Subtype of integers with two values: `True` and `False`.

```python
d = True
print(f'{d} -> {type(d)}')
```

Explanation:
- Integers are used for whole numbers.
- Floating-point numbers represent real numbers.
- Complex numbers are used for complex mathematics.
- Booleans are used for truth values.

## 3. Sequences <a class='anchor' id='sequence'></a>

Python has several sequence types: strings, tuples, and lists.

### 3.1 Strings
Ordered collection of characters.

```python
s = "Hello, World!"
print(f'{s} -> {type(s)}')
```

### 3.2 Tuples
Ordered, immutable collection of items.

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
print(f'{t} -> {type(t)}')
```

### 3.3 Lists
Ordered, mutable collection of items.

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
print(f'{l} -> {type(l)}')
```

Explanation:
- Strings are used for text.
- Tuples are used for collections that should not change.
- Lists are used for collections that can change.

---

## 4. Sets <a class='anchor' id='set'></a>

Unordered collection of unique items.

```python
set_example = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
print(f'{set_example} -> {type(set_example)}')
```

Explanation:
- Sets are used to store unique items.

---

## 5. Dictionaries <a class='anchor' id='dictionary'></a>

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

```python
d = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(f'{d} -> {type(d)}')
```

Explanation:
- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key-value pairs.
