# Directory Management in Unix

A directory is a file the solo job of which is to store the file names and the related information. All the files, whether ordinary, special, or directory, are contained in directories.

Unix uses a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories. This structure is often referred to as a directory tree. The tree has a single root node, the slash character (/), and all other directories are contained below it.

## Home Directory

Go to Home directory

```
cd ~
```

Suppose you have to go in any other user's home directory

```
cd ~username
```

To go in your last directory, Use the following command

```
cd -
```

## Absolute/Relative Pathnames

### Absolute Pathnames

Directories are arranged in a hierarchy with root (/) at the top. The position of any file within the hierarchy is described by its pathname.

Elements of a pathname are separated by a /. A pathname is absolute, if it is described in relation to root, thus absolute pathnames always begin with a /.

Following are some examples of absolute filenames.

```
/etc/passwd
/users/sjones/chem/notes
/dev/rdsk/Os3
```

### Relative Pathnames

A pathname can also be relative to your current working directory. Relative pathnames never begin with /. Relative to user amrood's home directory, some pathnames might look like this.

```
chem/notes
personal/res
```

## Listing Directories

List the files in a directory

```
ls dirname
```

List all the files contained in /usr/local directory

```
ls /usr/local
```

## Creating Directories

Create directory

```
mkdir dirname
```

Create test-dir directory in the /tmp directory

```
mkdir /tmp/test-dir
```

Create docs and pub directories

```
mkdir docs pub
```

## Creating Parent Directories

If there is no parent directory, mkdir issues an error message as follows

```
mkdir /tmp/amrood/test
mkdir: Failed to make directory "/tmp/amrood/test";
No such file or directory
```

In the above case, Specify the -p option to the mkdir command

```
mkdir -p /tmp/amrood/test

//Create all the required parent directories
```

## Removing Directories

Remove directories

```
rmdir dirname
```

Remove multiple directories

```
rmdir dirname1 dirname2 dirname3
```

## Changing Directories

Change directories

```
cd dirname
```

From this directory, cd to the directory /usr/home/seyeon

```
cd ../../home/seyeon
```

## Renaming Directories

mv(move) command can be used to rename a directory

```
mv olddir newdir
```

## The directories . (dot) and .. (dot dot)

The filename . (dot) represents the current working directory; and the filename .. (dot dot) represents the directory one level above the current working directory, often referred to as the parent directory.

If we enter the command to show a listing of the current working directories/files and use the -a option to list all the files and the -l option to provide the long listing, we will receive the following result.

```
ls -la
drwxrwxr-x    4    teacher   class   2048  Jul 16 17.56 .
drwxr-xr-x    60   root              1536  Jul 13 14:18 ..
----------    1    teacher   class   4210  May 1 08:27 .profile
-rwxr-xr-x    1    teacher   class   1948  May 12 13:42 memo
```
