# Nature of Data, Frequency Tables, and Graphs

## Overview
Statistics is the science of learning from data. It enables us to understand and make decisions about the real world based on data collected.

### Definitions
- **Population**: Every member of a group being studied. For instance, all cars in a parking lot are a population if you are studying cars.
- **Sample**: A part of the population used to represent the whole. If you check just one parking lot at a college to guess about all cars at the college, you are using a sample.

## Descriptive Statistics
This branch of statistics helps summarize large sets of data to make them understandable and actionable.

### Biased Sampling Method
A flawed sampling method that does not accurately represent the entire population.
- **Convenience sample**: Choosing the easiest data to collect, which may not be representative.
- **Volunteer sample**: Relying on people who offer to participate, who might not be typical of the population.

## Parameters and Statistics
- **Parameter**: A numerical value that tells us something about the entire population.
- **Statistic**: A numerical value that describes something about a sample derived from the population.

## Types of Data
- **Quantitative Data**: Data that can be measured or counted. It often answers "how much?" or "how many?"
- **Qualitative Data**: Data that describes categories or groups. It often answers "what type?" or "which category?"
- **Discrete Data**: Numeric data that has a countable number of values. For example, the number of students in a room.
- **Continuous Data**: Numeric data that can have an infinite number of values within a given range. For example, the height of students.

## Frequency Tables
These tables show how often each value in a set of data occurs. They help see which values are most common.

### Example
If a manager at a car shop wants to understand spending on engine parts, they might list all costs from several invoices in a frequency table to see which costs are most common.

## Data Organizing Techniques
Organizing data correctly can reveal patterns that are not obvious at first glance.

- **Histograms**: These use bars to show how many data points fall into each of several ranges.
- **Dot Plots**: These use a simple dot to represent each data point, which helps see the spread and concentration of data.
- **Stem and Leaf Plots**: These show numerical data in a semi-graphical format where each data point is split into a "stem" (like the tens place) and a "leaf" (like the units place).

## Graphical Representations
Visuals can help understand data quickly and effectively.

- **Pie Charts**: Useful for showing how a whole is divided. Each slice of the pie chart represents a different category.
- **Scatterplots**: These plots show how two variables are related. Each point represents one observation.

## Practice Problems
These problems help reinforce understanding by applying concepts to new data sets.

- **Problem 1**: Look at a frequency distribution and find errors in how it was put together.
- **Problem 2**: Using a histogram, answer questions about the data it represents.
- **Problem 3**: Calculate the width of classes and the relative frequency of each class in a histogram.
- **Problem 4**: Analyze a stem and leaf plot to determine the distribution shape and the number of data points.

### Key Statistical Tools
1. **Collection of Data**: Gathering the raw data needed for analysis.
2. **Organization of Data**: Sorting and structuring data so it can be analyzed.
3. **Summary of Data**: Calculating key statistics that summarize the data set.
4. **Presentation of Data**: Creating graphs and charts to make the data understandable to others.
