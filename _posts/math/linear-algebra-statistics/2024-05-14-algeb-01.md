# Nature of Data, Frequency Tables, and Graphs

## Overview

Statistics is the science of learning from data. It enables us to understand and make decisions about the real world based on data collected.

### Definitions

- **Population**: Every member of a group being studied. For instance, all cars in a parking lot are a population if you are studying cars.
- **Sample**: A part of the population used to represent the whole. If you check just one parking lot at a college to guess about all cars at the college, you are using a sample.

## Descriptive Statistics

This branch of statistics helps summarize large sets of data to make them understandable and actionable.

### Biased Sampling Method

A flawed sampling method that does not accurately represent the entire population.
- **Convenience sample**: Choosing the easiest data to collect, which may not be representative.
- **Volunteer sample**: Relying on people who offer to participate, who might not be typical of the population.

## Parameters and Statistics

- **Parameter**: A numerical value that tells us something about the entire population.
- **Statistic**: A numerical value that describes something about a sample derived from the population.

## Types of Data

- **Quantitative Data**: Data that can be measured or counted. It often answers "how much?" or "how many?"
- **Qualitative Data**: Data that describes categories or groups. It often answers "what type?" or "which category?"
- **Discrete Data**: Numeric data that has a countable number of values. For example, the number of students in a room.
- **Continuous Data**: Numeric data that can have an infinite number of values within a given range. For example, the height of students.

## Frequency Tables

These tables show how often each value in a set of data occurs. They help see which values are most common.

### Example

If a manager at a car shop wants to understand spending on engine parts, they might list all costs from several invoices in a frequency table to see which costs are most common.

## Data Organizing Techniques

Organizing data correctly can reveal patterns that are not obvious at first glance.

- **Histograms**: These use bars to show how many data points fall into each of several ranges.
- **Dot Plots**: These use a simple dot to represent each data point, which helps see the spread and concentration of data.
- **Stem and Leaf Plots**: These show numerical data in a semi-graphical format where each data point is split into a "stem" (like the tens place) and a "leaf" (like the units place).

## Graphical Representations

Visuals can help understand data quickly and effectively.

- **Pie Charts**: Useful for showing how a whole is divided. Each slice of the pie chart represents a different category.
- **Scatterplots**: These plots show how two variables are related. Each point represents one observation.

## Practice Problems

These problems help reinforce understanding by applying concepts to new data sets.

- **Problem 1**: Look at a frequency distribution and find errors in how it was put together.
- **Problem 2**: Using a histogram, answer questions about the data it represents.
- **Problem 3**: Calculate the width of classes and the relative frequency of each class in a histogram.
- **Problem 4**: Analyze a stem and leaf plot to determine the distribution shape and the number of data points.

## Key Statistical Tools

1. **Collection of Data**: Gathering the raw data needed for analysis.
2. **Organization of Data**: Sorting and structuring data so it can be analyzed.
3. **Summary of Data**: Calculating key statistics that summarize the data set.
4. **Presentation of Data**: Creating graphs and charts to make the data understandable to others.

# Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of Variation

## Overview

This document explores the fundamental statistics concepts of central tendency and variation, including mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. Understanding these measures helps in summarizing and describing datasets effectively.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Central tendency describes the center of a dataset or where the data tends to cluster. Here are the key measures:

### 1. Mean (Average)
- **Definition**: The mean is the total of all data points divided by the number of points. It is a critical measure that gives an overall idea of the dataset's performance but can be skewed by outliers (extremely high or low values compared to the rest).
- **Formula**: $$ \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} $$
- **Example**: For a sample of tree diameters [9.8, 10.2, ..., 24.5], the mean diameter is calculated by adding all diameters and dividing by the number of trees.

### 2. Median
- **Definition**: The median is the middle value of a dataset when arranged in order. It divides the dataset into two equal parts and is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.
- **Calculation**: Order the data, if the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle value. If even, it is the average of the two middle values.
- **Example**: For tree diameters arranged as [7.8, 9.8, ..., 24.5], the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values after sorting.

### 3. Mode
- **Definition**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is useful for categorical data and can reveal the most common category or preference among data points.
- **Example**: In a dataset of tree heights [4.5m, 7.5m, ..., 25.4m], the mode is the height that appears most often.

### 4. Midrange
- **Definition**: The midrange is the average of the highest and lowest values in the dataset, providing a quick sense of the dataâ€™s range.
- **Formula**: $$ \text{Midrange} = \frac{\text{Max value} + \text{Min value}}{2} $$
- **Sensitivity**: Like the mean, the midrange is sensitive to outliers.

## Measures of Variation

Variation measures tell us how spread out the data points are in a dataset.

### Range
- **Definition**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.
- **Example**: For numbers [1, 6, 11], the range is 10 (11 - 1).

### Variance and Standard Deviation
- **Variance**: Indicates the average of the squared differences from the Mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance and provides a measure of the spread of data points.
- **Formulas**:
  - **Population Variance**: $$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N} $$
  - **Sample Variance**: $$ s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1} $$
- **Example**: For data points [5, 3, 12, ...], calculate the mean first, then apply the variance formula.

## Sensitivity to Outliers
- Variance and standard deviation are influenced by outliers because they square the differences from the mean, amplifying the effects of extreme values.

## Empirical Rule (for Normal Distributions)
- This rule helps in understanding the spread around the mean:
  - 68% of data within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
  - 95% within 2 standard deviations.
  - 99.7% within 3 standard deviations.

## Practice Problems
- **Example**: Given the travel times [12, 10, 23, ..., 7] to campus, calculate the mean, median, mode, and midrange.
- **Variance Example**: Determine the variance for the first-year student math scores if the variance is given as 14400.

# Measures of Position

## Overview

This section explains how to understand and compare positions within a dataset using various statistical measures like Z-scores, percentiles, quartiles, and the interquartile range.

## Z-Scores

- **Definition**: A Z-score, or standard score, indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset.
- **Calculation**:
  - For a population: $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$
  - For a sample: $$ z = \frac{x - \overline{x}}{s} $$
- **Interpretation**: A Z-score helps compare results from different sets of data normalized around their means. For example, comparing test scores from two different tests by standardizing the scores.

## Percentiles

- **Definition**: A percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group falls.
- **Calculation**: The k-th percentile is the value below which k% of the data can be found.
- **Example**: To find the 40th percentile in a dataset, you would locate the value below which 40% of the data falls.

## Quartiles

- **Definition**: Quartiles divide data into quarters after it has been sorted into ascending order.
  - **First Quartile (Q1)**: 25th percentile
  - **Median (Q2)**: 50th percentile
  - **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 75th percentile
- **Calculation**: The median splits the dataset into two halves; Q1 is the median of the lower half, and Q3 is the median of the upper half.
- **Example**: Given numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the median (Q2) is 5, Q1 is 3, and Q3 is 7.

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

- **Definition**: The IQR is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile.
- **Calculation**: $$ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 $$
- **Interpretation**: The IQR measures the middle 50% of the data and is not sensitive to outliers.

## Outliers

- **Definition**: Outliers are values significantly higher or lower than most of the data. They can be:
  - **Mild outliers**: More than 1.5 times the IQR above Q3 or below Q1.
  - **Severe outliers**: More than 3 times the IQR above Q3 or below Q1.
- **Identification**: By calculating the IQR and then determining which values fall outside the expected range defined by 1.5x or 3x the IQR.

## Practice Problems

1. **Data Analysis**: Given the dataset [81, 79, 88, 67, 89, 87, 85, 83, 83], find the median, Q1, Q3, IQR, and identify any outliers.
2. **Tree Heights**: For a dataset [75, 94, 95, 98, 99, 103, 103, 104, 106, 156], find the median, Q3, and whether there are any outliers.
3. **Z-Scores**: Calculate the Z-score for a tree height of 10.0 inches, given a mean of 6.5 inches and a standard deviation of 1.7 inches. Also, find what height corresponds to 1.85 standard deviations below the mean.
